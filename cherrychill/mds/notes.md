<div class="caveats">

- This calculator will work best in the cherry growing regions in San Joaquin and Kern County (where the field work to model bark temperature was conducted).

- This calculator has data for the 2022-2025 growing seasons. 

- The 'tree bark' chill and traditional air temperature chill are both based on data from CIMIS weather stations. The CIMIS data have been cleaned and gap-filled using a new method. Hence the results from this calculator should be similar but not identical to chill portions from other websites that use uncorrected CIMIS data. 

- The "bark temperature" chill was developed for Cherry Trees, and may not as accurately reflect chill portions for other tree crops.

- This calculator is still under development and should not be used for orchard management decisions.
