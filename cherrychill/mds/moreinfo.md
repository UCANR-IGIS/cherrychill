### Additional Info

Accumulated winter chill is an important measure for cherry and other tree crops because it predicts when the trees are likely to bloom in the spring. This calculator reports the accumulated chill portions using two methods.

- the traditional method  
- an experimental method recently developed by researchers at UC Davis.  

Both of these methods use weather data from the CIMIS network. The new method computes chill portions based on a model of bark temperature, or “tree chill”, as opposed to the ambient air temperature.
