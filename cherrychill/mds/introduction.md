### Introduction

Accumulated winter chill is an important measure for cherry and other tree crops because it predicts when the trees are likely to bloom in the spring as well as the effectiveness of treatments to break dormancy. 

This calculator computes accumulated chill portions for a specific location using the i) traditional air temperature method as well as ii) a new "bark temperature" method. For details see the 'More Info' tab.

**Notes**

- This calculator will work best in the cherry growing regions in San Joaquin and Kern County (where the field work to model bark temperature was conducted).

- This calculator has data for the 2022-2025 growing seasons. 

- The 'tree bark' chill and traditional air temperature chill are both based on data from CIMIS weather stations. The CIMIS data have been cleaned and gap-filled using a new method. Hence the results from this calculator should be similar but not identical to chill portions from other websites that use uncorrected CIMIS data. 

- The "bark temperature" chill was developed for Cherry Trees, and may not as accurately reflect chill portions for other tree crops.

- This calculator is still under development and should not be used for orchard management decisions.
