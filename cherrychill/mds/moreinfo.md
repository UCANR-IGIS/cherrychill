### Additional Info

Accumulated winter chill is an important measure for cherry and other tree crops because it predicts when the trees are likely to bloom in the spring. This calculator reports the accumulated chill portions using two methods:

1. the traditional method which estimates chill from the ambient air temperature

2. an experimental method known as 'tree chill' developed by researchers at UC Davis that models the temperature of the bark.  

Both of these methods use data from [CIMIS](https://cimis.water.ca.gov/) weather stations. For more info, see:
