### Introduction

Accumulated winter chill is an important measure for cherry and other tree crops because it predicts when the trees are likely to bloom in the spring as well as the effectiveness of treatments to break dormancy. 

This calculator computes accumulated chill portions for a specific location using the i) traditional air temperature method as well as ii) a new "bark temperature" method. For details see the 'More Info' tab.
